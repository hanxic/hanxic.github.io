I am a senior at [the University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/), where I am extremely fortunate to research in Penn PL Club under the supervision of my advisor, [Dr. Steve Zdancewic](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~stevez/). I mainly worked on [the Vellvm Project](https://github.com/vellvm/vellvm), but are also working on other development, mainly in the Coq Proof Assistant. I am broadly interested in PL, compiler, and formal verification.

At Penn, I am pursuing an [uncoordinated dual bachelor's degree](https://undergrad-inside.wharton.upenn.edu/dual-degree-wharton/) between [Computer Science](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/) at the School of Engineering and Applied Science and [Economics](https://undergrad.wharton.upenn.edu/) at the Wharton School. I am also pursuing a MSE degree in [Computer and Information Science](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/graduate/program-offerings/mse-in-cis/).

I was also a Head Teaching Assistant for nine time during my time at Penn. Most recently, I'm a teaching assistant for **CIS 5520 Advanced Programming**, a graduate-level course about functional programming using Haskell. I have been a (Head) Teaching Assistant for **CIS 3200 / CIS 5020 / CIT 5960 Algorithms** for six times, courses about data structures, algorithmic paradigms, graph algorithms, and approximation; a Head Teaching Assistant for **NETS 3120 Theory of Networks**, a course about graph theory, random graphs, and PageRank; a Teaching Assistant for **CIS 5000 Software Foundations**, a graduate-level course about principles of programming languages using Coq.
